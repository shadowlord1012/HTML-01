            <p>The TurboGrafx-16, known as the PC Engine outside North America, is a home
                video game console designed by Hudson Soft and sold by NEC Home Electronics.
                It was the first console marketed in the fourth generation, commonly known as
                the 16-bit era, though the console has an 8-bit central processing unit (CPU)
                coupled with a 16-bit graphics processor. It was released in Japan in 1987 and
                in North America in 1989. In Europe the Japanese model was unofficially imported
                and distributed in the United Kingdom and France from 1988. In Japan, the system
                was launched as a competitor to the Famicom, but the delayed United States release
                meant that it ended up competing with the Sega Genesis and later the Super NES.
            </p>
            <p>The console has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit graphics processing unit (GPU) chipset
                consisting of a video display controller (VDC) and video color encoder. The GPUs are
                capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of just
                14 cm x 14 cm x 3.8 cm (5.5 in x 5.5 in x 1.5 in), the Japanese PC Engine is the smallest
                major home game console ever made. Games were released on HuCard cartridges and later
                the CD-ROM optical format with the TurboGrafx-CD add-on. The "16" in its North American
                name and the marketing of the console as a 16-bit platform despite having an 8-bit CPU
                was criticized by some as deceptive.

                    In Japan, the PC Engine was very successful. It gained strong third-party support and
                    eventually became the Super Famicom's main rival. However, the TurboGrafx-16 failed to
                    break into the North American market and was a commercial failure, which has been blamed
                    on the delayed release and inferior marketing. In Europe, the Japanese models were grey
                    market imported, modified, and distributed in France and the United Kingdom beginning in
                    1988, but an official PAL model (named simply "TurboGrafx" without the "16") planned
                    for 1990 was cancelled following the disappointing North American launch with the
                    already-manufactured stock of systems liquidated via mail-order retailers.
