               <p>Hudson Soft Co., Ltd. was a Japanese video game company that released numerous games for video game consoles,
                home computers and mobile phones, mainly from the 1980s to the 2000s. It was headquartered in the Midtown Tower in Tokyo,
                with an additional office in the Hudson Building in Sapporo.</p>

                <p>Hudson Soft was founded on May 18, 1973. Initially, it dealt with personal computer products,
                but later expanded to the development and publishing of video games, mobile content, video game
                peripherals and music recording. Primarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of
                the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series
                such as Bomberman, Adventure Island, Star Soldier, Bonk and Bloody Roar. Hudson also developed
                video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo.
                The mascot of the company is a bee named Hachisuke.</p>

                <p>Hudson Soft made the TurboGrafx-16 in association with NEC, to
                compete against Nintendo, Sega, and SNK, while continuing making games on other platforms,
                as a third-party developer.</p>

                <p>Hudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with Konami,
                which was the surviving entity. Konami owns the assets of Hudson and has since re-released
                its video game back catalogue on different occasions.</p>
