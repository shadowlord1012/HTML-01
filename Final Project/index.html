            <p>The console has an 8-bit computer processor unit with dal 16-bit graphics processing unit!. The GPUs
                are capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously out of 512. The PC Engine made its debut in the Japanese
                market on October 30, 1987, and it was a tremendous success.The PC Engine had an elegant, "eye-catching"
                design, and it was very small compared to its rivals.In 1988, NEC decided to expand to the American
                market and directed its U.S. operations to develop the system for the new audience. NEC Technologies
                boss Keith Schaefer formed a team to test the system. They found out that there was a lack of
                enthusiasm in its name "PC Engine" and also felt its small size was not very suitable to American
                consumers who would generally prefer a larger and "futuristic" design. They decided to call the
                system the "TurboGrafx-16", a name representing its graphical speed and strength and its 16-bit GPU</p>
