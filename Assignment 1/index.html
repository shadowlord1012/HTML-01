                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <p>Right outside of this one church town.
                    There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
                    got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground. This is God's country.
                    We pray for rain and thank him when it's fallin Cause it brings the
                    grain and a little bit of money. We put bck in the plate. I guess that's
                    why they call it Gods country.
                </p>

                <h3>Chorus</h3>
                <p> I saw the light in a sunrise. Sittin' back in the 40 on the muddy riverside.
                Getting baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'. Saved by the sound
                of the been found. Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound.
                The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around. this is God's country</p>

                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <p>We turn the dirt ad work until the week's done. We take break and break bread on
                Sunday, Then do it all again 'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)</p>
